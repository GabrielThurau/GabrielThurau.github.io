  This test utility is for duplicating products and adding a one time fee to only those duped products

  Additionally, we are wanting to connect these products to the cart in a test environment only -
  meaning that the control won't have those products and the one time fee in the ecosystem

  You can create a one time purchase fee and then make an URL like this to add the product to the cart.

  With the parameter after / cart being the product id and the :1 being the quantity
